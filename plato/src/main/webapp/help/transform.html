		<h1>Transformation of Measured Values</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		<p>This page explains how the transformation of measured leaf
			values in Plato works.</p>

			<h2>Why Transformation?</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Values in the requirements tree are measured in different units
			(seconds, euro, bits, goodness values). To be able to aggregate the
			different values they have to be transformed to a uniform scale.
			Experience has shown that a scale with the resolution of discrete
			values 0-5 with 0 being an unacceptable value and 5 the best possible
			result works very well.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<div class="sectiontitle">
			<h2>Transformation tables</h2>
		</div>
		<p>For every leaf in the tree a transformation table has to be
			created:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Ordinal Values, Yes/Acceptable/No</b> <br />For every
				ordinal or Yes/Acceptable/No value a numeric value has to be
				assigned. For an ordinal value that is considered better a higher
				numeric value has to be assigned than to an ordinal value that is
				considered worse. For an ordinal value that makes an alternative
				completely unacceptable '0'. <br /> <br />
				<div class="small">
					<img src="transform-ordinal.png"
						alt="Transformation table for ordinal values" />
				</div> <br /> <br />
			</li>

			<li><b>Numeric Values (Positive Number, Positive Integer,
					Int Range)</b> <br />For threshold values numeric values are assigned.
				By selecting the appropriate 'Threshold stepping' it can be chosen,
				if the transformation should be linear (interpolating between the
				values) or if steps should be used. <br />
				<div class="small">
					<img src="transform-numeric.png"
						alt="Transformation table for numeric values" />
				</div> <br /> <br />With "Steps" selected for Threshold Stepping, a
				measured value of eg. 65 would get the same transformed value as 60
				('3'). If you choose "Linear" the value will be interpolated between
				the transformation values, so a value of '3,5' would be assigned.<br />
				<div class="small">
					<img src="transform-stepping.png" alt="Transformation Stepping " />
				</div> <br /></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<b>The measured values from the evaluation are shown next to the
				transformation tables.</b><br />To help you select the correct numeric
			values for the transformation, all the measured results are shown in
			a table to the right of the transformation table. For every
			alternative the sample records (numbered one to number of sample
			records) are shown in one line. <br /> <br /> Additionally an
			Aggregation Mode has to be selected:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Worst result: </b>The values for all sample records are
					transformed (see step "Transform Measured Values") and the worst
					result of the transformed values is taken as overall value for this
					leaf.</li>
				<li><b>Arithmetic mean: </b>The arithmetic mean of the
					transformed values is used as overall value for this leaf.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			Below are example transformations for ordinal values and numeric
			values.<br /> <br /> <b>Transformation of ordinal values</b><br />
			In this example the enumerations in a document are evaluated. If the
			Enumeration is available and like it is in the original the value
			'yes' is assigned. For an enumeration that is still supported but
			changed, 'acceptable' would be selected. If the enumeration is not
			supported anymore 'no' is chosen for this values.<br />The
			transformed values are '5' for 'yes', as this is the best possible
			result, '3' for acceptable and '1' for 'no'. We did not assign '0' to
			'no', as it is not a knock-out criterion in our scenario.<br /> Next
			to the transformation table we can see the results for every
			alternative for the one sample record we have in our fictional plan.<br />
			As an aggregation method 'Worst' is selected. If we would have more
			than one sample record and we have 'acceptable' for one record and
			'yes' for every other record, the final value for this alternative
			would still be '3', as 'acceptable' is the worst result of all
			records for this alternative. <br /> <img
				src="transform-example1.png"
				alt="Example for transformation of ordinal values" /><br /> <br />
			<b>Transformation of numeric values</b><br /> This example shows how
			many MegaBytes per second an alternative is able to handle. The
			measured values are again shown next to the transformation table.
			'0.05' MByte/second is our best result, so we assigned '5' to this
			value. '0.01' was the worst result, so '1' is assigned. The other
			values are evenly distributed between these values.<br /> 'Steps' is
			selected for Threshold stepping, so if an alternative would be able
			to handle 0.019 MByte/second, the resulting value would still be '1'.<br />
			As Aggregation Method "Arithmetic Mean" has been selected. If we
			would have two sample records, 0.01 MByte/second for one of the
			records and 0.02 MByte/second for the other record the resulting
			transformed value would be the arithmetic mean of '1' and '2' ->
			'1.5'. <br /> <img src="transform-example2.png"
